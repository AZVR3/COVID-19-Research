The purpose of this project is to carry out a study on the accuracy of forecasting between the **ARIMA** model and the **PROPHET** model. They are both compared in terms of their **mean absolute percentage error** values. The lower the percentage, the more accurate the forecasted values are.

## Data infromation:
> 9/14/2022 ~ 10/29/2022 (45 observations, days)

## Data forecasted:
> 10/30/2022 ~ 1/30/2023 (3 months)
